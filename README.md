## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pipeline fails to run**
- Verify file paths are correct
- Check CSV encoding (should be UTF-8)
- Ensure Lakehouse is created and accessible

**Dataflow errors**
- Confirm data sources are accessible
- Check Power Query syntax and formulas
- Verify destination Lakehouse tables exist

**Semantic model shows no data**
- Refresh the semantic model manually
- Check relationships are defined correctly
- Verify filters aren't excluding all data

**Report visuals are blank**
- Ensure semantic model refresh completed
- Check slicer/filter settings
- Verify measure syntax is correct

Refer to **Appendix C** in the Lab Guide for detailed troubleshooting steps.
